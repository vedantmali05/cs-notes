                        Mode of data communication, aka <span class="highlight">Directional Modes</span> of data communication means the direction of flow of information between sender and receiver. Like we have multiplex in movie theatres, here:-
                        <span class="highlight">Simplex</span>, <span class="highlight">Full Duplex</span> and <span class="highlight">Full Duplex</span> based on the direction of exchange of information. Also based on <span class="highlight">synchronization</span>                        (activity of multiple things at a same time) :- <span class="highlight">Asynchronous</span> and <span class="highlight">Synchronous</span>.

                        In this prose, only the modes of data communication based on direction are noted.

                            Simplex, aka <span class="highlight">Unidirectional</span>, is the mode of data communication is possible in only one direction i.e. the data can be only sent but can never be received (sender => receiver). So, sender can never
                            be a receiver and receiver can never be a sender. This mode of communication is not handy in the present day as we need 2-way exchange of information. But this is still used in the fields where reply is not required. Examples
                            of Simplex are radio, TV, input devices like keyboard, announcement mics 🎤, etc.
