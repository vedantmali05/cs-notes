                            Softwares are becoming more and more complex and functional due to technological advances.
                            Before, conference calling was not even possible and now hundreds of people connect together
                            to play a game. Hence, now a need of advance from basic programming
                            principle is raised and Software Engineering came to rescue. Well, actually its a part of larger subject called "System Engineering".

                                finalized, the team works and delivers one increment in a sprint of usually 30 days.
                                Then after every sprint, the product backlog is re-evaluated,
                                analyzed and prioterized for the next sprint. It is simple and productive to incorporate
                                various practices of other Agile methods in Scrum.
